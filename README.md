# keeper-app

The Keeper app is a note-taking application that allows users to create, edit, and organize their notes. It is designed to be simple and user-friendly, with a clean and intuitive interface.

Users can create new notes by clicking on a "new note" button, and then typing in the text of their note. They can also edit and delete existing notes, as well as organize their notes into different categories or folders.

React is used to build the UI components for creating, editing, and deleting notes.

Here we are not connecting the application to the DataBase such as MongoDB or MySQL if you want to link it fell free to fork My project and work on it also you can send me a Pull request.
